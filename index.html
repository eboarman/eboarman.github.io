	<p> The Boarman family is well-traveled, and this website is a fun showcase of who has gone where and what sights they have seen. 
	It includes both domestic and international travel, as well as both the city and the countryside! Every photo has been taken by
the individual on their travels. The photos explore a wide breadth of entertainment, art, historical architecture, and the beauty of 
travel!	</p>
